Known Bugs: 26.07.2013 (Gal Sasson)

- cannot maintain horizontal scroll when dragging a number point.
- user must click 'stop' to go back to edit mode (closing sketch window does not work like 'stop')

todo:

- better way to handle float/int
- find better scheme to handle increment/decrement of numbers (slow at the beginning and goes faster later)
